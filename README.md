# RandomObjectsPopUp
A simple Unity C# script to enable objects randomly in a spherical range.

Usage: 
Put this script on an empty Game Object and the objects to pop up inside this Game Object. I wanted to avoid Instantiation so this script will get any transform inside its hierarchy.

Example of Usage:
I created this script to simulate fireworks popping out in the sky.
